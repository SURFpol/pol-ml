# Project Open Leermaterialen - Machine Learning
Experiments related to the study investigating the generation of machine-learning based metadata. Please note that all the code in this repository is experimental and not yet suitable for implementation. SURF does not warrant nor support this code.

# Data and Preprocessing
Documents and videos available within the Open Leermaterialen project. Approximately 850 documents and 255 videos. Classification based on the type of content (Lesson, Assignment, Reference, Test). Convert all documents to PDF, generate images based on the documents as input for the CNN. Capture video frames as CNN input.

Extraction of raw texts from documents as input for TF-IDF. Collection of video-annotations as TF-IDF input.

# Image Recognition
Convolutional Neural Network, VGG16, transfer learning. 50% accuracy.

# Classifying Text
TF-IDF, Logistic Regression. 80% accuracy.
